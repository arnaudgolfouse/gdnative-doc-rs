This contains css and javascript code used by the html backend.

The syntax highlighting is done by the javascript library [prism](https://prismjs.com/).

We support highlighting for the following languages: `CSS`, `C`, `C#`, `C++`, `EBNF`, `GDScript`, `GLSL`, `html`, `Markdown`, `Rust`, `xml`.

But more can be added if needed !
